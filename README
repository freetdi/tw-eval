tw-eval.sh

evaluate PACE2016 track A submissions.

USAGE:

tw-eval-ex.sh <grfile> <timeout>
tw-eval-he.sh <grfile> <timeout>

these programs run `tw-exact` and `tw-heuristic`, respectively, on grfile. send
SIGTERM after timeout and write test results (including logs) to stdout.

REMARK:

Both commands run the same script with slightly different parameters.

tw-eval-he.sh regularly sends USR1 signals to the process under evaluation.
this process, tw-heuristic, is expected to print the best known upper bound (to
stdout) at these times. the computed tree decomposition must prove these
bounds.

BUGS:

Uses multiple sleep to navigate time. The expenses are added to the reported
system resource usage.
